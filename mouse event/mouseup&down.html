        <h3><p id="use" onmousedown="mousedown()" onmouseup="mouseup()" >HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
             When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.To handle events in HTML, we would need to add the function in the HTML tag that will be required 
             to be executed in JavaScript when any of the events in the HTML tag is fired or triggered. There are multiple types of events in HTML like keyboard events, mouse events, form events, and many more.
