      <h2 class="card-title">HTML</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
          in a web browser.</li><br>
        <li>It defines the meaning and structure of web content.</li><br>
        <Li>It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
          JavaScript.</Li>

      <h2 class="card-title">History</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
          researchers to use and share documents.</li><br>
        <li>In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</li><br>
        <li>Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</li><br>
        <li>Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
          the project was not formally adopted by CERN.</li><br>

      <h2 class="card-title">Markup</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
          character-based data types, character references and entity references.</li><br>
        <li>HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like opening tag and closing tag,although some represent empty
          elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>.</li><br>
        <li>The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
          tags and closing tags).</li><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2 class="card-title">Semantic HTML</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its
          presentation (look).</li><br>
        <li> HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,but has also included presentational markup, such as
          font, i and center tags.</li><br>
        <li>There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s,</li><br>
        <li> when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to
          avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and presentation.

      <h2 class="card-title">Delivery</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li><br>
        <li>However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML.</li><br>
        <li>To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document.</li><br>
        <li>This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).</li><br>

    <div class="card">
      <h2 class="card-title">HTML4 variations</h2><br>
      <p>
        <li>The language for an element should be specified with a lang attribute rather than the XHTML xml:lang attribute.</li><br>
        <li> XHTML uses XML's built-in language-defining functionality attribute.</li><br>
        <li>Remove the XML namespace (xmlns=URI). HTML has no facilities for namespaces.</li><br>
        Change the document type declaration from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01.
